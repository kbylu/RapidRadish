# RapidRadish

빨리 무ve

RapidRadish is a productivity app designed for my own personal use. Primarily, it features as a replacement of separate calendar, to-do list, and note taking applications, while being personalisable for individual use.

Drawing inspiration from existing products: Todoist, Notion, Google Suite (Calendar, Keep, Tasks, Sheets), Microsoft Suite (To-Do, Excel).
